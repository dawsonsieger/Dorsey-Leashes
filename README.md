# Odin-Project---Landing-Page

This is a simple landing page following the "Holy Grail" template created as part of the Foundations section of the Odin Project.

Dorsey Leashes was inspired by my dog Petra. She is a Great Pyreness mix. Many will often joke that she is the size of a horse. Playing into the joke, my partner created the nickname "Dorsey" for her, which combines the words "dog" and "horsey".
